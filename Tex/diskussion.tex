\section{Discussion}
The discrepancy of the individual values for the gyromagnetic ratio can be explained by the interference
voltage. The earth's magnetic field has already been taken into account by the use of two frequencies.
The apparatus was carried out both in and against the direction of the earth's magnetic field.
In view of the low voltages used, the precision of the measurement, which shows a deviation of $14\%$, is in order.
