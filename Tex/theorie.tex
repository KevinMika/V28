\section{Motivation}
The motivation of this Experiment is to determine the magnetic moment caused by the Spin of a free electron.
Diphenylpikrylhydrazyl is a sample which offers free electrons. Methods of high frequency spectroscopy are used for this purpose:
The experimental conditions are varied until a resonance absorption of the electrons occur. With the resonance condition it is possible
to determine the magnetic moment.
